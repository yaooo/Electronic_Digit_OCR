dir.txt file is a file containing the names of the images in which you want to process.
For example, it could be like:

```
1.jpg
2.jpg
3.jpg
```

That means that I want to process 1.jpg, 2.jpg and 3.jpg.

In windows, you can just run "dir /a-d /b >dir.txt" after cd to the directory containing the images.
NOTICE: Please double click on the file and make sure dir.txt only has the image names, and manually erase the string "dir.txt".
