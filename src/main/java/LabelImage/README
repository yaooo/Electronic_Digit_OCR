Inside of the LabelImage folder, there are three tests for labelling images:

-- Blur test:
    Adjust the delta value to vary threshold to decide if the image is blurred.

-- Corruption test:
    Decide if the image is coded correctly because jpg always ends with "EE D9".

-- Dark test:
    Adjust the threshold if needed.
